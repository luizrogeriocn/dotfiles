# .dotfiles

Paste this into terminal if you are luizrogeriocn :)

```bash
bash -c "$(curl -#fL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/luizrogeriocn/.dotfiles/main/install)"
```

This will install some of my most used programs (listed below), as well as download this repository and create symlinks for the config files.
